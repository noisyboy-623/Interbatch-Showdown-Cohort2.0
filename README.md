## 🧠 How It Works

- Each element is a `<div>` with metadata stored using `data-*` attributes  
- A central state array manages **selection, layers, persistence, and export**  
- All transforms (drag / resize / rotate) are applied through a unified transform pipeline  
- Layout is restored automatically on page reload
